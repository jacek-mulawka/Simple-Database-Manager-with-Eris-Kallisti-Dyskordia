|-NO_VALIDITY|Do not restore database validity conditions.|Does not restore validity constraints. So you can restore data that does not meet these constraints and could not be restored otherwise.|
|-ONE_AT_A_TIME|Restore one table at a time.|Usually the restore takes place in one single transaction for the whole database. This switch puts a commit after each table. So you can use this to partially restore databases with corrupt table data.|
|-PAGE_SIZE|Override default page size.|Sets page size of new database. <size> can be one of 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192. Default is 1024.|4096|1024|2048|4096|8192|
V|-REPLACE_DATABASE|Replace database from backup file restore.|Restores over an existing database. This can only be performed by SYSDBA or the owner of the database that is overwritten. Do NOT restore over a database that is in use! [Firebird 1.0, 1.5].|
|-USE_ALL_SPACE|Do not reserve space for record versions.|Normally, on restore, database pages will be filled to about 80 %. With the use_all_space option, database pages will be filled to 100 %. (Useful for read-only databases which will see no more modifications.)|
